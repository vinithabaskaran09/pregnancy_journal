Pregnancy Journal App
------------------------------------------------
My pregnancy journal app empowers the expected and new parents to capture and preserve their unique experience and lasting memories that can be cherished for year to come.In my App user can create account and to ensure security the password are saved using hashed encrypted format. Once the user had created the account the user can login with the credentials and can create individual profiles (eg for mom and dad can have separate profiles). Also they have an option to have health-Info in their profile or not. Once the user have created the separate profile it will redirect the user to features page where the user can choose what features they want to update.
